Specifically, the network entity DB99.KWBC.NET is reported to have a status of 'Normal', indicating that it is functioning properly. In contrast, multiple descriptions indicate that the virtual machine (VM) has a status marked as 'Special'. This designation suggests that the VM is experiencing a unique or prioritized condition, possibly due to a specific event or configuration that differentiates it from standard operational parameters.\n\nAdditionally, the status of the VM is also noted as 'Normal' in some instances, which indicates that it is functioning within expected parameters. However, the predominance of 'Special' statuses for the VM suggests that there may be ongoing unique operational conditions that warrant attention. \n\nFurthermore, the status of other network entities, such as db40.kwbc.net and db87.kwbc.net, is also reported. The former is indicated to have a status of 'Normal', reflecting its operational health, while the latter is marked as 'Special', similar to the VM, suggesting a specific operational event or condition affecting it.\n\nIn summary, the overall status landscape includes:\n- DB99.KWBC.NET: 'Normal'\n- Virtual Machine: 'Special' (with some reports of 'Normal')\n- db40.kwbc.net: 'Normal'\n- db87.kwbc.net: 'Special'\n\nThis comprehensive overview highlights the varying operational states across the network entities and virtual machines, with a notable emphasis on the unique conditions affecting the virtual machine and db87.kwbc.net.\",13\n41,DB99.KWBC.NET,\"DB99.KWBC.NET is a network entity that operates with a normal operational status, indicating that it is functioning properly.

Additionally, there are multiple references to 1TB, 2TB, and 3TB allocations for different aspects of the virtual machine and infrastructure.\n\nSpecifically, the provisioned space for the virtual machine is noted to be 4TB, which is a key operational metric.

The 1TB allocation is highlighted as significant for infrastructure and network entities, while the 2TB and 3TB figures are also associated with the virtual machine's storage capacity.\n\nIn summary, \"\"Provisioned Space\"\" encompasses various storage allocations, with the virtual machine's total allocated storage being a critical metric, primarily noted as 4TB, but also including other values like 1TB, 2TB, and 3TB for different operational contexts.\",8\n129,20220712,\"The date 20220712 represents a significant event related to the backup service, possibly its last known configuration date.\",1\n130,20250326,The date 20250326 indicates a scheduled decommissioning date for the backup service.,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n29,VM,STATUS,\"The VM's operational status has been described in various ways, leading to some contradictions.
