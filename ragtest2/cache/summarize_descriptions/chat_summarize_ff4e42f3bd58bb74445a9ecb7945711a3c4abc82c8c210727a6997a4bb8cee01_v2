This status indicates that the VM is not functioning in a typical manner and is currently set to a special operational mode. The designation of \"Special\" suggests that the VM has unique operational parameters or conditions that may require attention or specific handling. This unique status may be associated with the VM's performance, configuration, or other operational characteristics. Additionally, the status \"Special\" can denote a unique operational event or condition affecting related services, such as web services or network classifications, indicating that the VM is operating under specific conditions that differ from standard operations.
