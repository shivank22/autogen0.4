The total memory allocated to the host is reported as 9.73 GB. However, specific allocations for different entities reveal a more complex picture: the network entity DB36.KWBC.NET has an allocation of 15.88 GB, while the virtual machine backup18.kwbc.net is allocated 11.90 GB. Another virtual machine, web4.kwbc.net, has a significantly higher allocation of 25.12 GB. Additionally, there is a general allocation of 29.56 GB for a virtual machine, which may refer to a different instance or configuration.\n\nIn terms of available memory, the host has 23.49 GB accessible, and the overall memory capacity for the network entity is noted as 24.73 GB.
