In this context, several specific hosts are identified, each serving as a server for a virtual machine (VM) and often functioning as proxy servers that facilitate network requests and support the VM's operations.\n\nThe hosts identified include:\n\n- **Host 'ijkl23.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is a server that provides resources and connectivity for the virtual machine. It is explicitly mentioned as the server hosting the VM and is associated with its operations.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl31.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host serves as a proxy for the virtual machine.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl39.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is identified as the server for the virtual machine.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl44.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is noted as the server or service that runs the VM.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl58.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is both a server hosting the virtual machine and associated with its operations.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl70.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host serves as the hosting service for the virtual machine.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl73.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is associated with the virtual machine and provides necessary infrastructure for its operation.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl87.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is identified as a server that runs the VM and is also a proxy server associated with the virtual machine.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl96.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is another server hosting the virtual machine and is involved in its operations.\n\n- **Host 'ijkl99.uxe.proxy.bet'**: This host is associated with the virtual machine.\n\nOverall, these hosts collectively provide the necessary resources, connectivity, and infrastructure for the virtual machine's operation, with each host identified by its unique proxy address.
