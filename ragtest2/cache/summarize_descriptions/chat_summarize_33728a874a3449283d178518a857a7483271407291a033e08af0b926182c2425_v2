However, the most coherent summary indicates that the VM has a status of 'Normal', which signifies that it is functioning properly and its health and performance levels are stable. Despite this, there are also mentions of the VM having a 'Special' status, which suggests a specific condition that may affect its operational capabilities. Ultimately, the prevailing indication is that the VM is currently operating under a 'Normal' status, reflecting its proper functioning, while the 'Special' status may refer to a particular context or condition that does not seem to be the current operational state.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1738695601, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_72ed7ab54c", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 341, "total_tokens": 470, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
